<strong>libscript</strong> is a plugin-based library designed to add
language-independent extensibility to applications.
</p>

<p>
It allows to decouple an application from the virtual machines provided by the
various scripting languages. The main library, <em>libscript</em>, is a thin layer that provides a
language-independent scripting API, allowing the application to register its
functions and invoke code to be performed. Libscript then invokes the
appropriate plugin (<em>libscript-python</em>, <em>libscript-ruby</em>, <em>libscript-lua</em>, etc.)
to run the code. This way, the application can support all those scripting
languages without adding each of them as a dependency.
</p>

<p>
<strong>libscript</strong> was developed by <a

his MSc dissertation at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-RIO</a>.

INSERT INTO "toycms_post" VALUES(6,'LuaDec','			<h2>LuaDec, Lua bytecode decompiler</h2>

		        <h3>Overview</h3>

		  <p>LuaDec is a decompiler for the Lua language. It takes compiled Lua bytecodes and attempts to produce equivalent
		   Lua source code on standard output. It targets Lua 5.0.2.<p>


<p>
The decompiler performs two passes. The first pass is considered a "preliminary
pass". Only two actions are performed: addresses of backward jumps are gathered
for <code>while</code> constructs, and variables referenced by <code>CLOSE</code>

instructions are taken note of in order to identify the point where explicit
<code>do</code> blocks should be opened.
</p>
<p>
The actual decompilation takes place in the second, "main pass". In this pass,
the instructions are symbolically interpreted. As functions are traversed
recursively, the symbolic content of registers are kept track of, as well as
a few additional data structures: two register stacks, one for "variable
registers" (registers currently allocated for variables) one for "temporary
registers" (registers holding temporary values); and a list of boolean conditions. 
</p>
<p>
Instructions like <code>ADD</code> and <code>MOVE</code> combine the string
representation of symbols and move them around in registers. Emission of actual
statements is delayed until the temporaries stack is empty, so that constructs
like <code>a,b=b,a</code> are processed correctly. 

</p>
<p>
The list of boolean conditions accumulate pairs of relational operators (or
<code>TEST</code>s and jumps). The translation of a list into a boolean expression
is done in three stages. In the first stage, jump addresses are checked to identify
"then" and "else" addresses and to break the list into smaller lists in the case of
nested <code>if</code> statements. In the second stage, the relations between the
jumps is analyzed serially to devise a parenthization scheme. In the third scheme,
taking into account the parenthization and an ''inversion'' flag (used to tell
"jump-if-true" from "jump-if-false" expressions), the expression is printed,
recursively.
</p>
<p>
Two forms of "backpatching" are used in the main processing pass: boolean conditions
for <code>while</code> constructs are inserted in the marked addresses (as noted in
the first pass), and <code>do</code> blocks are added as necessary, according to the
liveness information of local variables.

</p>
		  <p>LuaDec is written by <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~hisham">Hisham Muhammad</a>, and is licensed
		  under the same terms as Lua. Windows binaries contributed by Fabio Mascarenhas.</a></p>

                       <h3>Status</h3>

<p>
LuaDec, in its current form, is <i>not</i> a complete decompiler. It does
succeed in decompiling most of the Lua constructs, so it could be used as
a tool to aid in retrieving lost sources.
</p>

<p>
The situations where LuaDec "get it wrong" are usually related to deciding
whether a sequence of relational constructs including <code>TEST</code> operators
are part of an assignment or an <code>if</code> construct. Also, the "single pass"
nature of the symbolic interpreter fails at some corner cases where there simply
is not enough information in the sequence of operator/jump pairs to identify what
are the "then" and "else" addresses. This is an example of such a case:

<h3>Running it</h3>

<p>
To try out LuaDec:
</p>

<pre>
make
bin/luac test/life.lua
bin/luadec luac.out > newlife.lua
bin/lua newlife.lua
</pre>

<p>
LuaDec includes a <code><b>-d</b></code> flag, which displays the progress
of the symbolic interpretation: for each bytecode, the variable stacks
and the code generated so far are shown.
</p>

<h3>Operation modes</h3>

<p>
In its default operation mode, LuaDec recursively processes the program functions,
starting from the outmost chunk ("main"). When LuaDec detects a decompilation error
(by doing sanity checks on its internal data structures), Luadec outputs the portion
of the function decompiled so far, and resumes decompilation in the outer closure.
</p>

<p>
There is an alternative operation mode, set with the <code><b>-f</b></code> flag,
where all functions are decompiled separately. This does not generate a .lua file
structured like the original program, but it is useful in the cases where a
decompilation error makes a closure declaration "unreachable" in the default
operation mode. This allows a larger portion of the sources to be restored in
the event of errors.

<p><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is a scripting language not totally unlike 
						Tcl, Perl, or Python. Like Tcl, Lua is an "embedded language", in the sense that embedding 
						the interpreter into your
						program is a trivial task, and it is very easy to interface Lua with other languages
						like C, C++, or even Fortran. Like Python, Lua has a clear and intuitive syntax. 
						Like all those three, Lua is an interpreted language with dynamic typing, and with 
						several reflexive facilities.</p>

            
            <p>What sets Lua apart from those languages is its portability, simplicity, and small size. 
						Lua is written in ANSI C, and runs without modifications in almost any platform (MS-DOS, 
						all versions of Windows, all flavors of Unix, plus X-Box, PlayStation II, OS/2, BeOS, 
						EPOC, etc.). The whole program lua.exe has less than 200 Kbytes. Its simplicity led other 
						groups to adopt Lua as a scripting language for other scripting languages (see, for 
						instance, <a href="http://ruby-lua.unolotiene.com">Ruby-Lua</a>).</p>
            
            <p>Currently, Lua has a strong presence whenever programmers need a light, efficient,
						and portable language. It is being used by some tens of thousands programmers around 
						the world, both in research and in industrial projects. Lua has been successfully 
						used in games (e.g. Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island, MK2, Baldur''s Gate), 
						in robots (e.g. Crazy Ivan, that won the Danish RoboCup in 2000 and 2001), and 
						several other applications (e.g. a hot-swappable Ethernet switch (CPC4400), a genetic 
						sequence visualization system (GUPPY), "The most Linux on one floppy disk" (tomsrtbt)). 
						An extended list of applications using Lua can be found  
						<a href="http://www.lua.org/uses.html">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The Lua.NET project integrates Lua with the 
						<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/clr/">Common Language Infrastructure</a>,
						a framework for language interoperability. 
						This integration allows Lua 
						to act both as a "client" language and as a "server" language, although with a
						limited capacity for the latter. As a client, Lua scripts can access components available 
						through the CLI. As a server, Lua scripts can implement new components accessible by 
						other languages integrated with the CLI.<p>
            
            <p>Because Lua is an interpreted language with dynamic typing, its integration with 
						the CLI demands a dynamic nature. Lua.NET employs two approaches for this integration. 
						The first uses the same techniques used to implement <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luaorb">LuaOrb</a>, 
						a scripting tool that can	access and implement CORBA, COM and Java 
						components. The approach is implemented by the <a href="luainterface/">LuaInterface</a> library.</p>

            
            <p>The second approach compiles Lua to the CLI''s Common Intermediate 
						Language, instead of its own bytecode representation. This approach is implemented
						by the <a href="lua2il/">Lua2IL</a> compiler.</p>
